In the event of a total catastrophic failure, these commands and instructions will rebuild the project on the host

1) Install the latest version of node (>14) with latest online tutorials
    Make sure its path is /usr/bin/node
        or update other files accordingly

2) Install ruby 2.5 and jekyll with the following commands
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
sudo gem install jekyll bundler

3) Cause the code to run with a pr so you get a wiki install (and consecutively hard crash)

4) Run this command in the docs folder of the wiki
sudo gem install bundler -v "$(grep -A 1 "BUNDLED WITH" Gemfile.lock | tail -n 1)" 

    Ignore the warnings about how this is really bad practice

    (Installing This takes a while)

5) Load the service file into /etc/systemd/system/

6) use systemctl to make it all work
