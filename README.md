# EPS Web Preview
A nodejs script to track, download, and enable seamless contribution for pull requests.

This utility is maintained and hosted by Ben MacDonald (@Quantum158), on behalf of the E.P. Scarlett Technical Theatre Crew.


## Functions
The bot is hosted on an external provider and listens for pull request webhooks sent from the wiki repository. When a payload is received, the script attempts to download the pull request's branch and build the site using a jekyll instance. Multiple jekyll instances can be run simultaneously, one per pull request. 

The bot attempts to keep each instance open for 6 hours following the most recent commit to a PR. An instance is destroyed after these six hours, or earlier if the PR is closed for any reason.


## Usage
